This Project was put together by Leah Lewis, Ryan Wakabayashi, Colin Campbell, and Jacob Worden in the Fall of 2021 for
Intro to Machine Learning at Texas State University. In this project we used machine learning approaches to both predict
asteroid diameter and whether or not an asteroid is physically hazardous.
